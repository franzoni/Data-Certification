    "An autoencoder was trained on JetHT data, split 80:20+all bad lumisections appended at the end. Then, 10 different AEs were trained on the same split with reduced number of features. Features were determined from original AE's ability to reconstruct them well. Correlaction coefficien was calculated for each feature's distibution and its reconstruction. All features reconstructed worse than a set threshold were discarded for the training. Aditionally, all features with zero variance were discarded beforehand. Below is comparison between different thresholds."

Also, with less features latter lumisections start to drift upwards a little bit, which may suggest that those models are less capable of adapting to concept drift."
